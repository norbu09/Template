clone the repsitory to where ever you have repositories like this :-)

- link the bin/template script to a location that holds executables (~/bin
  might be a good place)
- link etc/template.conf to ~/templaterc
- link share to somewhere and fix the line in the config pointing to it

to use the thing:

# template lib/New/Module.pm "Awesome new module doing fancy stuff"

creates a file called lib/New/Module.pm and fills the file with the
temlate from share/pm.
extend the system by adding templates and specific extensions ... still
really basic but good enough for the moment
